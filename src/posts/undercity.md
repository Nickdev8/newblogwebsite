## Good Morning

I set my alarm for 9am… and of course I slept right through it. Woke up late with barely enough time to get ready. Thomas was at the house booking flights home for everyone, and after helping a bit, I grabbed my stuff and headed out to **Undercity**.

Took the metro, walked a bit, and then suddenly I was here. surrounded by nearly **200 other hackers** ready to build and ship.

## What Is Undercity?

**Undercity** is a multi-day hardware-focused hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ, run by Hack Club. It’s the latest event under the umbrella of **Highway**, a summer program supporting students in building ambitious, creative projects.

Undercity is intense, inspiring, and packed with projects. Think:

*   Hackers sleeping on the floor
*   Real deadlines
*   Free meals
*   Hardware chaos
*   Plushie prizes
*   And more unforgettable moments than you can count

## I Met Paperclip

At the start of the event, **Paperclip** announced:

> "The first person to tag me with a paperclip gets something."

Naturally, I came prepared. with **two boxes** of paperclips, over 300 total. I handed them out to everyone just because I found it funny.

Meeting Paperclip for the first time was awesome. She’s small, full of energy, and incredibly welcoming. She ran around saying hi to everyone, instantly lifting the vibe of the entire room.

## Starting Presentation

The opening presentation set the tone for everything to come:

*   Build a hardware project
*   Top 10 get plushies
*   First place gets a **3D printer**
*   Second and third place get secret prizes

I didn’t officially join a team. I just wanted to enjoy the experience and get away from what Neighborhood had become. I loosely teamed with **SPC**, but mostly I floated and had fun. And honestly? That worked out really well.

## The Rest of Day 1

The rest of the day I mostly spent with Paperclip. helping with badges, talking with people, just having a great time.

## Morning Vibes

Despite sleeping on the floor, I had a surprisingly great night's sleep. My hip hurt a bit from laying on my side, but it was still a good night.
Right after waking up, the demos started. Paperclip’s team (Evan & Samith) built a working **chocolate 3D printer**. Yes, really. Chocolate. It was incredible to see it working.

## Refresh and Reset

I quickly went back home to shower, shave, and generally not feel like a mess. On my way back to GitHub HQ, I walked past a Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants game.

It was cool to see that part of American sports culture up close. My grandfather would’ve loved this moment.
Ik hou van je, opa.

## Time Flies
These Days all just went to fast, and with a blink of an eye. its already day 3

## I Had Lunch with Paperclip and John Cohn

I met [John Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cohn) without realizing who he was. We grabbed Chipotle together. me, him, and Paperclip. and had some amazing conversations.

He gave me a [Sam Stone](http://samstones.org/WordPress1/?page_id=37), a tradition he’s known for, and shared personal stories full of meaning.

John is the kind of person everyone deserves to meet at least once. Sadly, he was leaving the next day to set up a massive light show. I’ll miss him.

## Rooftop Views

After lunch, we headed to the rooftop of GitHub HQ. Beautiful views, deep conversations, and that surreal feeling of being somewhere really special.

## Zach

[Zach Latta](https://zachlatta.com/) is the founder of Hack Club. and easily one of the most inspiring people I’ve met.

He started Hack Club because he wanted teenagers to feel like they could build real things. Not school projects. Not assignments. But things that *matter*.

Talking to him in person reminded me that this whole thing. Undercity, Neighborhood, even Juice last year. exists because he believed kids like me could do more than just sit in a classroom.

He listens, he encourages, and he genuinely cares.

This week has been chaotic, emotional, beautiful. and somehow, it all still feels like just the beginning.

## Final Demos

Today was the big one. The final demos.

The room was buzzing with energy. everyone setting up their projects, helping each other troubleshoot last-minute bugs, and rushing to finish details. Despite the chaos, it was beautiful.

There were so many cool things to see:
A glove that controlled a computer.
A glowing LED cube running a game of Snake.
And the winner? A **toilet paper folder**. Yes. That won first place. And honestly? It deserved it.

After the demos and voting, we had one last group presentation, followed by the awards. People clapped, laughed, celebrated their work.
Paperclip's team eventily got into the top 10

And then… it was over.

We cleaned up the space, packed our bags, and stood around in small circles, not quite ready to say goodbye.

## Goodbye

The last few days have been *unmatchable*.
Not just fun. but something deeper.

This week has been the **best time I’ve ever had**. By far.

I didn’t expect that. I came here after the chaos of Neighborhood, just hoping for a soft landing. What I found was something close to magic.

Spending time with these people, building, laughing, dancing, sitting on the floor writing code at 1am... it felt like I belonged in a way I haven’t felt in a long time.

And Paperclip. she made it all even more special. Her energy, her joy, her way of making everyone feel seen.

It hurts to let go of this.
But I know I’ll carry it with me.
The people. The memories. The feeling of building something that matters.

Thank you, Undercity.
You changed me.
