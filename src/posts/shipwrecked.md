## Off to the Island

The adventure has officially started! I'm currently at Munich Airport for a layover, and this place is wild. I read online that there's minigolf, a giant giraffe statue, and even a climbing park somewhere in here. Time to explore!

I found the minigolf course, but didn't have a chance to play. It looked as random and amazing as it sounds! Now, I'm on a quest to find that giraffe. This layover is turning into a mini-adventure of its own. Shipwrecked, here I come!
