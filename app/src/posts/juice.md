## Pop-up Arcade Energy

Sixty-ish days of heads-down building paid off: every teen who logged 100+ hours on a languageless game in Juice earned a flight to Shanghai. We crammed rigs into a borrowed cafe, opened the doors to the street, and suddenly nearly a hundred builders were demoing Steam-ready projects for curious strangers wandering in off Nanjing Road.

## Why It Matters
Hack Club backed the visas, housing, and travel stipends so no one missed out, and AdventureX helped anchor us locally.

For one intense week (April 4–11), we proved that a teen-led jam can cross oceans, translate without words, and still feel as intimate as a LAN party—short, sweet, and totally electric.
