## **What is Moonshot**
Moonshot is another HackClub event, where is you make a project with 75+ Hours, 
You get to go to Orlando Florida, Universal Studios and a tour at Kennedy Space Center.

## **What is HackClub**
Hack Club is a non-profit that encourages teenagers to code,
they hold events where you get prizes for shipping personal projects.

## **We got what we need!**
For moonshot Me and Nazli, made a project for school. A Disco Prullenbak (trashbin). 
Its a big blue bin, where as soon as you throw something in -> Music start playing, Led start dancing, Smoke mashine goes off and a disco ball spins!
And along with some other smaller projects we both got enough hours to come

## **its official!**
I've got the tickets, post event accomodation, hotels in Orlando and Miami and a nice layover in New York during Christmas! This is going to be amazing!! Me and Nazli are so so exited!
