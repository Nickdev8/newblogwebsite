## **What is Moonshot**
Moonshot is another HackClub event, where is you make a project with 75+ Hours, 
You get to go to Orlando Florida, Universal Studios and a tour at Kennedy Space Center.

## **What is HackClub**
Hack Club is a non-profit that encourages teenagers to code,
they hold events where you get prizes for shipping personal projects.

## **We got what we need!**
For moonshot Me and Nazli, made a project for school. A Disco Prullenbak (trashbin). 
Its a big blue bin, where as soon as you throw something in -> Music start playing, Led start dancing, Smoke mashine goes off and a disco ball spins!
And along with some other smaller projects we both got enough hours to come

## **its official!**
I've got the tickets, post event accomodation, hotels in Orlando and Miami and a nice layover in New York during Christmas! This is going to be amazing!! Me and Nazli are so so exited!

## **Almost There**

Today really felt like the beginning of everything. The bags are packed, chargers checked, documents triple-checked. School tomorrow feels almost unreal knowing that right after, **we leave.**

## **Me and Nazli**

Me and Nazli can almost taste it. Just pure excitement. Talking about *Florida, NASA, Miami beaches, and New York lights.* It still does not fully *feel* real that this is actually happening.

## **That Restless Feeling**

It is that mix of excitement and nervous energy. Hard to focus on anything. Hard to sit still. Everything feels like it is on pause until the moment we step on that plane.

*Two more days.*
