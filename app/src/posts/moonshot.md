## **What is Moonshot**
Moonshot is another HackClub event, where you make a project with 75+ hours.  
You get to go to Orlando, Florida, Universal Studios, and take a tour at Kennedy Space Center.

## **What is HackClub**
Hack Club is a non-profit that encourages teenagers to code.  
They host events where you get prizes for shipping personal projects.

## **We got what we need!**
For Moonshot, me and Nasi made a project for school. A Disco Prullenbak (trash bin).  
It is a big blue bin where, as soon as you throw something in, music starts playing, LEDs start dancing, a smoke machine goes off, and a disco ball spins.

Along with some other smaller projects, we both got enough hours to come.

## **It’s official!**
I have got the tickets, post-event accommodation, hotels in Orlando and Miami, and a nice layover in New York during Christmas.  
This is going to be amazing. Me and Nasi are so excited.

## **First Orlando**
12 Dec. First, we arrive in Orlando and meet 100 other HackClubbers. In Orlando we go to Universal Studios and Kennedy Space Center. If we are lucky, we might witness a rocket launch.

After that, we will go to the Titanic museum and just experience Orlando.

## **Then comes Miami**
16 Dec. After the main HackClub event is over, me and Nasi take a train or bus to **Miami**.  
We got a hotel on *South Beach*, with an ideal location. A couple of minutes from the beach and close to a bus stop. We will stay there for 7–8 days.

## **Final destination**
24 Dec. After all that exciting stuff, me and Nasi take an early flight to *New York*.  
We arrive around 5pm and, since it is the last stop, see the hotspots on the 25th. Then we leave the country around 9pm and get back home on the 26th at 10:30.

## **Summary**
*12–16 Dec,* **Orlando**  
*16–24 Dec,* **Miami**  
*24–25 Dec,* **New York**

## **Almost There**
Today really felt like the beginning of everything. The bags are packed, chargers checked, documents triple-checked. School tomorrow feels almost unreal knowing that right after, **we leave.**

## **Me and Nasi**
Nasi and I can almost taste it. Just pure excitement. Talking about *Florida, NASA, Miami beaches, and New York lights.*  
It still does not fully *feel* real that this is actually happening.

## **That Restless Feeling**
It is that mix of excitement and nervous energy. Hard to focus on anything. Hard to sit still. Everything feels like it is on pause until the moment we step on that plane.

*Two more days.*

## **Morning Chaos**

I woke up about **30 minutes** before I had to leave. No slow start. Just grabbing the last things, rushing out the door, and driving straight to Schiphol.

I met up with Nasi, boarded the plane, and just like that, the trip officially started.

## **The Flight**
The flight was long. About 10 hours.
We passed the time by sleeping. Then sleeping some more. And somewhere in between, a single game of UNO.

Honestly, it went by faster than expected.

## **We Landed**
After landing, we looked around for the adult picking us up. That was **Jared**. We talked for a bit until **Moukal** arrived, and then the four of us took an Uber to the hotel.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/13decjarred.JPG)

## **Food Before Anything Else**
First stop after arriving was the dining hall.
We were not even hungry, but somehow ended up with way too much food anyway. At one point, Nasi had five full plates in front of her. Then someone showed up with cake.

It was impressive.

## **Opening Ceremony**
After checking in and feeling extremely tired, we went straight back down for the opening ceremony. This is where they explained the rules, the schedule, and what the next few days would look like.

One rule that will be important for tomorrow's blog. We are not allowed to leave the hotel or venue.

## The Project Prompt
That night, we each picked three notes. Each note had one word on it. Together, they formed the theme for our project.

We got:
* *Cryptic message*
* *Fail*
* *Overheated laptop*

## The Idea
We decided to make a word game. You unscramble words and sentences.
Every time you lose a life, your score multiplier goes up. So the whole game becomes a balance between playing it safe or taking risks.

**Not bad for day one.**

## **Morning**
We woke up around 10am, with Universal Studios planned for later that day. For lunch, we were given $20 and some free time before leaving.

With a few hours to spare, we thought it would be fine to quickly grab food off-site.

That assumption turned out to be wrong.

## **What Went Wrong**
We misunderstood the boundaries around leaving the venue. Even though waivers allowed unsupervised time during specific activities, we overlooked the rule that we were not allowed to leave the hotel outside of those moments.

That part is on me.

## **Back at the Hotel**
We returned as soon as we were asked to and spoke with the organizers. Because we had left the venue, we were told we could not join the Universal Studios outing and needed to stay in our room and remain reachable.

What bothered me was not just the consequence, but how it was handled.

## **Where the Frustration Set In**
Even though Nasi and I were together the entire time, all the frustration and blame was directed at me. I was told I needed to change my behavior. I was told that if it were Graham’s decision alone, I would have been sent home that same day.

That hit **hard.**

It did not feel like a shared mistake anymore. It felt personal.

## **How It Felt**
I could not shake the feeling that this was not just about today. That my past issues within Hack Club played a role in how quickly things escalated, and how easily the focus landed on me.

I owned the mistake. But being singled out like that felt unfair.

## **Reflection**
Rules matter. I understand that.
But so does fairness.

This day left me angry, confused, and honestly pretty hurt.
Not because of Universal Studios.
But because of how fast trust seemed to disappear.

Lesson learned.

## **Morning Talk**
We woke up to a DM from Graham saying he wanted to talk after breakfast. That already set the tone for the day.

Downstairs, he explained that Zach had given Graham and Emma full authority to decide consequences after yesterday. 
We were told that the only reason we were still here was because they did not want to leave our third teammate, Csaba, alone for the hackathon.

They added one more condition. If they did not hear from **Csaba** that we had been good teammates by the end, we would be sent home.

That sat *heavy.*

![](/blogimages/moonshot/14decinthesunprogramming.jpg)

## **Kennedy Space Center**
After that conversation, we got ready and took the bus to Kennedy Space Center.

Once we arrived, everything shifted. 
We had full access to the visitor complex, and honestly, it was incredible. Walking around rockets, exhibits, and history helped clear my head.

Seeing the Saturn V in person was unreal. Photos do not do it justice. Standing underneath it, I genuinely could not wrap my head around how massive it is.

Too Much From the Gift Shop

Of course, we exited through the gift shop. And of course, we bought way too much.
**Worth it.**

## **Back and Confused**
After heading back with Hack Club, we found a place to eat near the hotel. After that, we were told we were allowed to walk back on our own.

That part felt strange. Earlier we were not allowed to leave the hotel for fifteen minutes with an Uber in the middle of the day. Now we were allowed to walk back alone at night.

It did **not** make much sense.

## **Morning Rush**
We woke up way too late and skipped breakfast again. We packed our bags, double-checked everything, checked out, and went straight downstairs to the venue.

It was **presentation day.**

## **Demo Time**
We built a game and wanted to make the demo interactive. The idea was to let people play and give something to the top three scores.

That idea came from **Csaba,**
who still had prizes from a previous Daydream event he hosted. It worked surprisingly well and made the demo feel fun instead of stiff.

## **Leaving Orlando**
After everything wrapped up, we walked to the next hotel. Then walked some more. Took another detour. Eventually, we ended up at our hotel and finally slept.

## **Night Mission**
Around midnight, we went to downtown Orlando. Then at 1:30am, we drove for about an hour toward Cape Canaveral.

Jetty Park was closed, so we stopped at Banana Creek instead.

## **Atlas V**
From there, we had an amazing view of the Atlas V rocket. Seeing it lit up in the dark was surreal. Quiet, massive, and powerful.

Around 5am, we arrived back at the Cambria Hotel in Orlando.

*Exhausted.* But **glad we went.**

## Leaving Orlando
We woke up around 10am. The first thing Nasi said was,
“I wanna swim.”

Ten minutes later she came back.
“It’s too cold.”

After a warm shower, we started packing. That is when we realized we had about ten minutes before checkout. Shoes in our hands, bags half-zipped, we made it downstairs at exactly 11am. Just in time.

## One Last Stop
We stored our bags at reception and took a bus to **Florida Mall**.
We shopped. Hard.

I scored two new pairs of shorts and a white shirt that I immediately ruined by spilling boba on it. Classic.

## The Journey South
After grabbing our bags, we barely made it to the bus to Miami.
That FlixBus was easily one of the sketchiest vehicles I have ever been on.

We were sitting next to an emergency window. Half-open. While driving full speed.
Cold air blasting in. The window shaking like it might give up at any moment.

We were laughing, but also not really.

## Arrival
Once we arrived, we took bus 150. The payment machine was broken, so the ride was free. A small win.

Check-in took a while, but once we finally got into our room, I laid down and instantly fell asleep.

Orlando was officially over.
Next up: **Miami. Just Nasi and me.**

## A Slow Morning
We woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in days. Around noon, we went out to get breakfast. We had barely eaten properly in over 24 hours.

We were craving real food.

## Pancake Mission
We found a place called **Craft** and ordered American pancakes.
And honestly? Best breakfast I have had in a long time. No contest.

That meal alone already made Miami feel different.

## Beach and Target
After breakfast, we walked along the beach for a bit. Just sitting, watching the ocean, letting everything slow down.

Later, we went to Target. Because of course we did.

## Downtown Miami
That evening, we headed to downtown Miami and had dinner at a small Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy. Just good food and a relaxed vibe.

The day went by fast. In a good way.

## The Robots
On the way back, we noticed something strange.
Delivery robots. Everywhere.

They were driving around on the sidewalks like it was completely normal. Apparently, it is.

Miami already feels unreal.

title: "Miami Day 2: Beach Day"
date: "2025-12-18T12:00:00"
---

## **Woke Up Hot**
This morning was unbearably hot. The kind of heat where you feel like you are melting the second you step outside.

No complaints though. This is Miami.

## **Downtown Errand**
We went to downtown Miami to find a currency exchange. Got some cash, walked around a bit, and very quickly decided on one thing.

We needed to swim.

## **South Beach Mode**
We headed back to South Beach and fully committed to doing nothing else.

No phones.  
No plans.  
Just sun, water, and sand.

We stayed there the entire day and only made our way back at night, completely covered in sand and absolutely exhausted.

## **The Sand War**
At one point, I was laying down, doing absolutely nothing, when Nasi came running over asking if I wanted to swim.

A few minutes later, she started putting sand on me.

*Big mistake.*

I got my revenge by covering her from neck to toe in sand. Fully buried. No mercy.

Then we swam for a long time until the sun started going down.

## **Late Night Wind Down**
We got back to the hotel late, slept for a couple of hours, and then woke up again to watch a movie.

Of all things, **Despicable Me 2**.  
We ate some chips in bed and just laid there.

After starting movies on other nights and never finishing them, we actually watched this one all the way through.

A perfect end to a very Miami day.

date: "2025-12-19T12:00:00"
---
## **A Different Plan**
Today we decided to do something other than the beach.  
We wanted to explore more of Miami itself.

Before heading out, we stopped at Target to get some more snacks for the evening.

## **Wynwood**
After that, we took the bus to *Wynwood*.  
The area is full of massive murals, graffiti, and street art. Every wall feels intentional. It is loud, creative, and constantly moving.

We walked around for a long time, just looking at the art and soaking in the atmosphere.

## **Little Havana**
Later, we headed toward **Little Havana**. The buses here are not great, so after waiting way too long, we gave up and booked an Uber.

We walked through the streets, browsed some shops, and listened to Cuban music playing everywhere. We still have not tried the famous Cuban sandwiches, unfortunately.

We did have some really good pizza though.

## **Ending the Day**
After a long day of walking and exploring, we headed back to the hotel and watched a movie before bed.

A calm ending to a full day.

## Back to the Beach
We woke up late again. Around midday.  
The first thing we did was go straight to the beach.

There is something about just laying there, listening to the waves, and feeling the warmth that never gets old.

## **Bayside Marketplace**

After the beach, we went to **Bayside Marketplace** in downtown Miami.  
Lots of small gift shops, souvenirs, and pure tourist chaos.

Yes, we bought **MAGA hats**.  
Purely as a joke. But honestly, I kind of love them.

![](/blogimages/moonshot/20decbayideshops.jpg)
## **Chili’s Mission**
There was a Chili’s nearby, and since a friend told us to go to one together, we did.

We ordered what felt like the entire menu.  
Chicken, mac and cheese, mozzarella sticks. Everything.

We did not finish it.

![](/blogimages/moonshot/20deceatingathebayside.jpg)

## **Music and Chill**
After eating, we found a spot with music playing.  
Songs like *Vem Dançar Kuduro* and *La Negra Tiene Tumbao*.

We sat there for almost two hours, just listening, relaxing, and doing nothing.

One of those days that feels simple and perfect.

## **Gun Range Attempt**
Today we tried to find a gun range that we could both go to.  
We found one, but once we saw the prices, that idea ended very quickly.

The cheapest option was around **350 euros**.
Hard no.

![](/blogimages/moonshot/21decthegunrange.JPG)
## **Walmart Adventure**
Instead, we went to a nearby **Walmart**.  
Those places are massive.

They sell everything. Toys, clothes, food, electronics.  
And the chips section alone was insane. Entire aisles full of absurdly large bags from every brand imaginable.

It was overwhelming, but also kind of fun.

A strange, very American way to end the day.

date: "2025-12-22T12:00:00"
---
## *Late Start*
We started the day around 11am. After a really nice, calm morning together, we decided to go to the beach again. One more time. Just to feel the waves and be there.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/21deconthebeaches.JPG)

## *Solo Walk*
At some point, I walked by myself along the entire stretch of the beach. Past the **Art Deco** buildings, along that long road next to the sand. Just looking around, taking it in.

After a while, I found *Nasi* again, laying near the water. I laid down next to her for a bit before going into the ocean.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/22deconthebeach.jpg)

I **loved”* it.


## Cheesecake Factory
After the beach, we went to **The Cheesecake Factory**. It was actually really good, but also very filling, very fast. We had mac and cheese and walked around a bit more afterward.

## Real Talk
On the way back, we talked about some really personal things. About how we are each other’s number one best friend. About how much we have both grown over the past fourteen days.

It was one of those conversations that sticks.

## Chick-fil-A Again
Later, we went to **Chick-fil-A**.  
Even though I was already full from earlier, I still ate two chicken burgers and a lot of nuggets.

Zero regrets.

## Last Night Feeling
That night, we laid down and watched a movie again. Tomorrow would be our last day, and we both felt it.

While getting ready for bed, Nasi showed me all the little stings she got from tiny jellyfish in the water. Blue buttons. All over her arms and chest.

Not ideal. But still worth it.

date: "2025-12-23T12:00:00"

## **The Best Day**
This was my favorite day of the entire trip.

We started as early as possible and headed to **Wynwood** to pick up our analog film. Holding the developed photos felt special. Seeing the negatives was especially cool. I could even take a picture of them, invert the colors, and actually see the image appear. Really interesting.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/23decnickwithcamera.jpg)


## **Brickell Bound**
After that, we made our way downtown to **Brickell City Centre**, the biggest mall in Miami. We walked around for hours, tried on clothes, and just enjoyed being there.

At some point, we bought movie tickets for **Avatar 3** without fully realizing what time it would end.

That would come back to haunt us later.

## **Dinner and People Watching**
Before the movie, we went to a nice Italian restaurant. Spaghetti, pizza, good food, calm vibes.

At the table next to us sat a mother and daughter livestreaming on TikTok the entire time. Talking to their phones, reacting, smiling on cue. It felt incredibly artificial. No hate, just strange to witness up close.

It was oddly entertaining.

## **Late Movie Night**
The movie started at 10pm.  
We did not really think about the fact that it would end around 1am.

But it was worth it.

Avatar 3 was great. Multiple storylines happening at once, slowly coming together at the end. Not predictable. Not really a fairytale either. Just immersive and different. Easily my favorite of all time. After Interstellar of course.

## **Almost No Sleep**
We got back to the hotel by Uber around 3am.  
Our alarms were set for 7am.

We packed most of our stuff, laid down, and fell asleep almost instantly.

Exhausted. Happy. And very aware that Miami was over.

A perfect final day.


## **Next up**
Tomorrow we're leaving for New York early in the morning. In that post ill just talk about NYC. not the trip getting there

## **Thrown Into It**
We landed in New York after a short flight from Miami, running on almost no sleep. The difference hit instantly. Cold air. Faster pace. No soft landing.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/24decairplanetojfk.JPG)

From the airport it was straight into movement. Trains, transfers, walking, following signs, dragging bags. We were awake, but barely present.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/24inmetrojfk.JPG)

## **Accidental Landmarks**
As soon as we exited the metro, we accidentally walked straight into **Rockefeller Center**.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/24decrockefeller.jpg)

Crowds everywhere. People stacked on top of each other. Lights, noise, cameras, the Christmas tree. Impressive, yes. But overwhelming. Way too much as a first impression.

We dropped off our luggage as quickly as possible, which helped immediately. No bags made the city feel lighter.

Looking for something quieter, we walked into a side street.

Which turned out to be **Times Square**.

Again. Screens, lights, crowds, chaos. Tourists stopping randomly, people rushing past them. Everything screaming for attention. We both thought the same thing.

*Not again.*

So we walked away, following smaller streets, just trying to escape the noise.

And somehow, without planning it at all, we ended up on **Broadway**. Right in front of the theater where **Hamilton** takes place. That moment felt different. Still busy, but calmer. Purposeful. Genuinely cool.

## **Reset Mode**
After all that stimulus, we stopped at a **McDonald’s**. Nothing special. Just warmth, food, and somewhere to sit.

Exhaustion caught up fast, so we went to a movie theater just to rest. Darkness, seats, quiet. Exactly what we needed.
![](/blogimages/moonshot/24lastdayaftermovie.JPG)


## **Cold Streets and a Closed City**
After the movie, we went back outside. It was colder. We walked south for a bit to see the **Empire State Building**, but the cold kept creeping in.

What surprised us most was how dead the city felt. Christmas Eve. Almost everything closed. Few places to warm up. Few places to just exist.

After more than two hours of walking, the only place we found open was an **Apple Store**. We went in and sat down on a bench.

Apparently, I fell asleep instantly. Nazli later told me I slept for almost an hour and a half. A worker even came up to me saying I could not sleep there. I did not wake up. Nazli tried shaking me. Nothing.

I was gone.

## **The Scam**
Eventually, I woke up and we booked sleeping pods near Central Park for about 200 bucks. It was around 4am when we arrived.

There was a guy there. Let’s call him *Jamal*.

He asked for copies of our IDs, signatures, and a 50-dollar deposit. Then told us we had to wait until 5am to check in.

When we finally got the rooms, we realized they were separate. I was placed with a random stranger. I just wanted to grab my stuff from Nazli’s room.

Then Jamal started knocking. When we did not answer, he **opened the door himself**. Nazli was already getting ready for bed. Zero privacy.

He told us we had to leave. Immediately. No refund. We had not even been there for ten minutes.

While standing awkwardly in the elevator, I got an email.  
A **$250 charge** had just been made to my card.

In total, we were down almost **$500**, without a place to sleep.

Later, we would see Jamal laying in a subway hallway. Homeless. Scamming people. That made everything click. Anger, frustration, disbelief. We were tired, cold, and taken advantage of.

## **Just Sit Somewhere**
By then it was almost 6am. At 7am, we booked seats at a cinema just for somewhere warm to sit.

We watched **Zootopia 2**, but mostly we slept. We arrived hours early, sat down, and passed out until loud moments in the movie woke me up.

## **One Last Thing**
We felt like we had seen enough of New York. Except one thing.

We took the subway to **World Trade Center** and visited the **9/11 Memorial**. Quiet. Heavy. Beautiful in a respectful way.

After that, we walked to **Battery Park** and took the **Staten Island Ferry**. The Statue of Liberty was smaller than expected. Still special. Still worth seeing.

## **Leaving**
And just like that, it was time to go.

New York was not easy. Not gentle. Not warm.

But it was *real.*

And somehow, that made it unforgettable.

## **The End of This Chapter**
![](/blogimages/moonshot/24decsantabeforeflight.jpg)
This trip has been the best vacation I have ever had.  
For me and for Nazli.

It was full of laughter, emotions, and moments I will never forget. We did incredible things. We saw beautiful places. And we also experienced some of the worst moments of the trip.

But we did all of it *together.*

There was never a moment where one of us did not want to go, or did not want to try. Every day started with excitement. Always wanting to see *something*. Go *somewhere*. Experience **more**. Not once did it feel forced. Not once did it feel boring.

## **What We Miss Already**
We both agree on one thing.  
We want to go back.

Back to South Beach. Back to the sand. Back to the warmth. Back to waking up next to each other and starting the day with no plan except doing something together.

To be honest, that is what we both wish for right now.

## **For the Future Us**
If Nazli and I ever read this again, I hope we can have days like these once more. Days where everything feels open. Where curiosity wins. Where time does not matter as much.

And if we do, you can bet I will be blogging it again.

## **Thank You**
Thank you to everyone who followed along, supported us, and made this trip possible.

This was more than a vacation.  
It was a memory we will carry with us forever.
